# Role Playing System Events
This is an event database for the Elkarte mod Role Playing System.

The mod will download the events based on year and requested holidays/moon phases from [events.cody-williams.info](http://events.cody-williams.info) where this database is currently hosted.

The holiday and moon phase data originally came from the [U.S. Naval Observatory's Astronomical Applications API 2.0](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/api.php).

Original json data as well as the mysql database sql is included in the repository.
